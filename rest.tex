\chapter{REST}

First you have to get some dead tissue (the knack here is in also managing to
avoid a short custodial sentence for grave-robbing). Then you need one of

conducted in a suitable dark and ancient castle, in close proximity to a town
of highly suspicious and pitchfork-wielding peasants.
